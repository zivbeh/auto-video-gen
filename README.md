Automatic Video Generator

Generates a video based on a prompt by adding images, videos, audios from the internet. Uses AI applications such as ChatGPT to create the script and captions based on the prompt, giving a list of image prompts that will be used by a different API to retrieve images to be used in the video, uses an API to create a voiceover made by an AI, adds it all togther into one output.mp4 file which it will upload onto youtube automatically.

How it will work:

The prompt can be a the topic of the video, I will use chat gpt to generate a script which I will use to create voiceover and captions, next I will use chat gpt to generate a list of images and videos that can be on the screen like a slideshow as the voiceover is speaking. Finally, I would add all of it together and save it on a mp4 file.
